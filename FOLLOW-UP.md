What libraries did you use? Why did you use them?
- I only use the Angular Material UI component

If you had more time, what further improvements or new features would you add?
- better design, probably if more data it will be better if state management will be implemented, and for the features i think sorting works here where they can choose a specific data that they want to sort. Also, maybe not a feature to add but following coding standard and using best practices is really important.

Which parts are you most proud of? And why?

there aren't much features so I think I'm proud in terms of keeping the code clean and readable. 
 
Which parts did you spend the most time with? What did you find most difficult? css and design
